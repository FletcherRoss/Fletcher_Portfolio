# Project 1: Automated Customer Service KPI Measurements

This is a project I created to capture Customer Service KPI measurement through an automated PowerBi dashboard that would refresh daily.

#Data was extrapolated from SQL Server databases through SQL code
#Information is organized via team and leader with the options to filter datasets by date, leader and department the agent works in
#Additional analysis is incorporated to show high level overviews of specfic areas of interest (For Example: Customer Retention, First Call Resolution, etc.)
#Agent KPI's are highlighted for specfic measures where the agent may or may not be meeting the industry goals
#Some agent KPI's are analytic measures that use multiple datasets to create a calculated measure (For Example: Revenue per Case, Average Agent Satisfaction, etc.)
